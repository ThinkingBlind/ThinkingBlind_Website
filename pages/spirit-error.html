    <h1>The Spirit of Error</h1>
    <p>
        The spirit of error isn't just "being wrong." It's the pattern of 
        protecting a lie because it feels safer than facing the truth.

        <li>Projecting your fears onto everyone else as if they're the threat.</li>
        <li>Cofusing stubbornness with faitfulness.</li>
    </ul>
