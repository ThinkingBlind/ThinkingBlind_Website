    <p>
        In Thinking Blind, a "posture" is the way your heart and mind stand toward truth.
        It's less about what you know and more about how you're willing to wrestle with what's real.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Postures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Curious</strong> - willling to ask uncomftable questions.</li>
        <li><strong>Honest</strong> - refusing to lie to yourself just to feel safe.</li>
        <li><strong>Patient</strong> - lettng understanding unfold instead of forcing it.</li>
        <li><strong>Humble</strong> - open to being wrong without collapsing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Practice These Postures</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Notice when you feel defensive or triggered by an idea</li>
        <li>Pause long enough to ask, "What truth might I be avoiding here?"</li>
        <li>Write down what you honestly think,, even if it's messy.</li>
        <li>Compare that with what's actually true over time, not just in the moment.</li>
    </ol>
